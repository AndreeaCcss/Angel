# ANGEL

The systems broke down at the airport where Angel works at. Angel must sit passengers into their corresponding seats, following his own sketchy system of rules.

## Getting Started

Fast-csv reads and processes the passengers data from data.csv. Angel's criteria for admitting passengers onboard are applied for processing. 


### Usage

To run this code, type in the console your destination of choice, like so:

```
node hmm.js "JFK"
```
The flight destination must match flight_destination in data.csv
